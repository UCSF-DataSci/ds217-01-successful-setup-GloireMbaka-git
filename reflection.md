# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
I moved from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to San Francisco to join UCSFâ€™s PhD program in Epidemiology and Clinical Translational Science. I am currently doing my second year. I am interested in malaria and infectious disease epidemiology, biostatistics, and the use of mathematical and statistical models to inform malaria public health strategies in low transmission and fragile contexts. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I am looking forward to gaining advanced anaytical skills essential to my phd project because I would like to exploit machine learning to address one of my questions. Carrerwise, I would like to be prepared for the induustry as well. 
## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
Data analysis and research findings excite the most. Specifically, the use of data to guide decision making and inform public health strategies. My concern might be that I have not been exposed to Pythin before but I am positive that I will be able to succeed. 
## 4. Share something you enjoy!
Here is a link to my Master's of Public Health thesis that was published.
